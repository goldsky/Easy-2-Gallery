********** 1.4.0-Release Candidate 4 **********
+ Bug fixing on the chmod permissions
+ Bug fixing on the directory editing
+ Moving around the class methods into separate files.
+ Added French lang files (credit: Marc)
+ Thumbnails on module page
+ Added more options for the thumbnail generator
+ Created a new method to hold the slideshow variables
+ Sliced the snippet's pagination to be shorter
+ Changed the &crumbs_use option values: 'foldername' => 'cat_name' | 'alias' => 'cat_alias'
+ Renamed the file's 'name' field to be 'alias' to distinct the term with filename
+ New parameters :
  + For manual templates:
      + &glib=`0`           : will disable all the gallery's headers loading.
      + &autoload_css=`0`   : will disable the gallery's CSS headers loading.
      + &autoload_js=`0`    : will disable the gallery's JS headers loading.
      + &autoload_html=`0`  : will disable the gallery's HTML block headers loading.
  + &use_redirect_link:
    The thumbnails (directories or images) now can be redirected to a specified link that has been set from inside Module.
    Empty content will make the links fall back to the original E2G's link.
+ Deprecated parameters :
  - &pagenum_class
    Specified the class directly on the template
  - &back_class
    Specified the class directly on the template
+ Updated the floatbox to 4.20 version

SOMETHING MAY BREAK ON UPGRADING:
+ Custom Slideshow:
  This version now stores the slideshows parameters inside a method.
  The usage should be changed just like this:
  + To get all the slideshow parameters: $ssParams = $this->_getSlideShowParams();
  + To gel all the slideshow files     : $ssFiles = $this->_getSlideShowFiles();
+ Directory's link:
  since now the E2G's thumbnails can be redirected to a specified link, the template's placeholder has been changed:
  old: <a href="[+easy2:link+][+easy2:cat_id+][+easy2:cat_tag+]#[+easy2:permalink+]">
  new: <a href="[+easy2:link+]">

MODULE
1. file's/folder's name will not be renamed again
