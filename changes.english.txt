+ Now you can have multi IDs, for &fid, &gid, &rgid
+ Introducing some parameters:
--+ &showonly : images | folders
--+ $customgetparams (for nesting with other snippets)
+ Directory & images share same pagination

MODULE
1. file's/folder's name will not be renamed again
2. the original folder's & file's names restoration in the upgrading installation process
